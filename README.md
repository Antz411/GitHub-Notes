General Notes Across the Board

These would any kind of notes kept specifically for Ubuntu control and maintenance.
This may take over my previous note system.
Though branching is unneccessary for notes... Or is it?

Now that note is branched, make changes to branch and add back.
Only once changes are approved from GIT side then attmpt merge.

[2018-03-19]
Now making another change and not adding/committing/pushing...
Save changes to be murged later
